Web line snaps across a streetlight and wraps the case.
THIEF: Hey!

The case pops open in midair. A small meteorite pulses green.
PETER (thought): That is not normal geologic behavior.

Panel 6
Spider-Man lands on a fire escape as the meteorite hums louder.
SPIDER-MAN: Note to self: never trust a rock with mood lighting.

Panel 7
The thief lunges with a shock baton.
THIEF: Hand it back!
SPIDER-MAN: Counter-offer: you stop committing felonies.

Panel 8
Spider-Man webs the baton and yanks it into a trash bin.
SPIDER-MAN: Recycling is important.

Panel 9
The meteorite emits a wave that flickers nearby streetlights.
CROWD: Whoa!
PETER (thought): If that surge hits the grid, Queens goes dark.

Panel 10
Spider-Man wraps the meteorite in layered webbing and seals it inside the case.
SPIDER-MAN: Improvised insulation. Please hold.

Panel 11
Police arrive and cuff the thief.
OFFICER: You again?
SPIDER-MAN: You say that like I have hobbies.

Panel 12
Dawn breaks. Peter hands the case to a city science team.

PETER (thought): Maybe one good save can keep the lights on for everyone.
